## Base 10:
    Common system used everywhere
    290 -> 2x10^2 + 9x10^1 + 0x10^0

## Base 2:
    Also called binary
    100101 -> 1x2^0 + 0x2^1 + 1x2^2 + 0x2^3 + 0x2^4 + 1x2^5 = 37 in base 10

    Thus if we use 8 binary digits the highest numer we can create (11111111) is 255 (2^n - 1)
    An integer uses 8 bytes (64 bits) giving a very large numer

    From Base 2 to hexadesimal we need groups of 4 digits in binary. To complet a group with less dan four digits in we will use the method of padding (adding zero's in fornt)

# Personal Budget Calculator – Project 1

A simple, interactive console program that uses **only** the topics from Chapters 2 & 3:

- Basic program structure & `main()`
- Comments (`//` and `/* */`)
- `cout` / `cin`
- Variables & all fundamental data types
- Arithmetic operators
- `if-else` statements
- `bool`, `char`, `int`, `double`, `float`, `auto`
- Integer modifiers (`unsigned`, `short`, `long`, etc.)

No loops, arrays, or functions (except `main`) are required.

## Project Goal

Create a program that:
1. Asks the user for their monthly income and several expenses.
2. Calculates total expenses, remaining money, and daily budget.
3. Tells the user if they are saving money or going into debt.
4. Gives extra useful/fun feedback.
